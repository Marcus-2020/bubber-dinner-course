# bubber-dinner-course

This project is being developed in conjunction with the **ASP.NET 6 REST API Following CLEAN ARCHITECTURE & DDD Tutorial** from **Amichai Mantinband** in **YouTube**.

## What this project/tutorial is about

According with the author:
> We'll build a REST API following Clean Architecture & Domain-Driven Design principles completely from scratch.
> We will use .NET 6, EF Core, and common patterns such as CQRS, unit of work, repository, mediator, and more 💪🏽
> We'll also use some awesome open-source libraries such as MediatR, FluentValidation, ErrorOr, Throw, Mapster, and more.
> The developing environment will be visual studio code & dotnet CLI only. We will use awesome vscode plugins for everything from sending HTTP requests to connecting to our SQL database, debugging, and peeking at JWT tokens.
> We will code and refactor multiple times to tackle the many concepts I want to teach. When the series will be over, you'll have a good understanding and intuition on how to use these patterns & libraries in your industry-level applications.
